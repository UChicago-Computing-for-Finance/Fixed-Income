    "\n",
    "The idea here is to earn the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates as long as bond prices don’t move much.\n",
    "\n",
    "The large loss we see comes from what actually happened to interest rates between 2021 and 2022. Rates rose sharply across the entire yield curve. When rates rise, bond prices fall — and **long-term bonds fall much more than short-term bonds** because they are more sensitive to interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means:\n",
    "- The **5-year bond we owned lost a lot of value**, and\n",
    "- The **1-year bond we shorted did not protect us much**, even though its funding cost increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this trade was very **highly leveraged** (only $4 million supporting $200 million of positions), these price moves were large enough to wipe out the initial capital and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the big loss is not a mistake — it reflects the fact that carry trades make money only when rates are stable, and they suffer large losses when rates jump, as they did in 2021–2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the loss probably wouldn't be as large because we would have forcibly closed the position earlier.\n",

    "In this experiment, we force the one-year interest rate each year to equal the forward rates implied by the yield curve in Nov 2020. This removes interest-rate surprises: the yield curve evolves exactly as the market expected in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this path, the carry trade makes money. The 5-year bond gradually rolls down the yield curve into shorter-maturity bonds with lower yields, so its price rises each year. At the same time, the 1-year funding rate remains lower than the yield locked in on the long bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the trade earns the carry embedded in the 2020 yield curve, producing a positive final return of about **19% on the initial $4 million**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that the carry trade would have worked if rates had followed the path implied by the forward curve. The large loss in 1.1 came not from the carry itself, but from unexpected rate hikes that caused long-term bond prices to fall.\n"
